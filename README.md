# Interactive live-time map of the urban mobility in Sofia
Using the live API data that's been recently made public by the Sofia Urban mobility center and an array of Python libraries I have created an app that displays the location of a user-chosen line, which includes buses, trams and trolleys, represented as interactable objects. Each object also carries additional information besides the vehicle's current location, including direction and occupancy.

I am currently working on porting the map to a web-based platform, as well as including the user's current location on the map itself.
